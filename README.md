# hello-world
I want to learn how to code.
I'm a 21 year old male that loves video games and my pet dog.
I live with my dad to help him pay for bills because he is retired.
I have a loving girlfriend that supports me in anything I do.
Back then I never liked school, or ever wanted to learn. I was stubborn and childish and thought I was smart enough for anything.
Learning from my past, I now know how important it is to get an education. 
I wish I had figured this out sooner so that i wouldn't be so behind in furthering my education.
Anyways, I just want to suceed in life so that I could have a family in the future without struggling.
Curious of what coding really meant, I randomly went to freecodecamp.com to see if coding is really for me.
Finding something that I am passionate about is my main goal as of right now and hopefully coding could be it.
